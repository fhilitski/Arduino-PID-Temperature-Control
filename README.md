# Arduino-PID-Temperature-Control
Use Arduino Uno to set and control temperature

Description: This project describes how to make an autonomous temperature control unit based on Arduino Uno.
This project requires assembly of hardwardware as well as programming the Arduino board.

Required Hardware:
  Arduino Uno Board - to control the process
  Thermocouple, Thermistor or other temperature sensor  - to measure the temperature
  Heating/Cooling element (like Peltier device) - to heat or cool 
  Power Source  - to supplu power to the Arduino board and the heater/cooler 
  
  The project can be improved by using LED screen, button inputs, Bluetooth or Internet connectivity, and many other things limited only by ones imagination and creativity.
